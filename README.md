## Current Progress

- **Example Fox Entity** Added a basic fox entity, which is currently unanimated. Inherits behavior from vanilla foxes

## Breeding Mechanics

- When two foxes are bred, the child will have a tail count equal to the lowest parent count minus one. for example, a two and a one will give a two, where a two and a two will give a three.
- Breed different elemental foxes to create a hybrid combining the powers of both parents, when hybrids are bred they follow a TBD inheritance system

## Hybrid Foxes

- Hybrid foxes inherit abilities from both parent elements.
- A dynamically generated system blends the breeds of each parent, creating hybrids such as fire/ice or end/lightning/stone.

## Spawn Eggs

- Spawn eggs are available for each elemental fox, at each rarity, but not for hybrids. for example, a fire level four but not a fire/ice level two
